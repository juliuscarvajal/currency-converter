## Serving the Application Files

### Running the App during Development

The angular-seed project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver.  It is a node.js
tool called http-server.  You can start this webserver with `npm start` but you may choose to
install the tool globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by
running:

```
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
```

Now browse to the app at http://localhost:8000/app.
